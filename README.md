# Welcome to My Site

Hi, I'm **Raghav Singh**, a data analyst and graduate student in Data Science at CSU. I specialize in using data to solve real-world problems for small to mid-sized business who want to unlock the value that is currently dormant in their data or set up the structure to collect data and create a historical record for analysis. 

## About Me

I'm currently building my website, SignalBoardAnalytics.com and launching my Data Analytics Consulting business. Both will be live by January 1st 2026

## Current Projects

### Apache Airflow to automate ETL for Snowflake
This project demonstrates how to integrate Apache Airflow with Snowflake to build automated ETL workflows. It includes step-by-step instructions for setting up Airflow in a Linux environment using WSL, configuring connections to Snowflake, and creating DAGs for orchestrating SQL tasks. The goal is to provide a practical guide for deploying scalable, reliable data pipelines with full visibility and error handling.
