# Welcome to My Site

Hi, I'm **Raghav Singh**, a data analyst and graduate student in Data Science at CSU. I specialize in using data to solve real-world problems, especially those that impact underserved communities.

## About Me

I'm currently working with [Project: Return to Work Inc. (R2W)](https://www.return2work.org), a nonprofit dedicated to helping veterans and individuals with disabilities reintegrate into the workforce. At R2W, I lead business intelligence efforts, mentor STEM interns, and support grant writing and program design.

## Current Projects

### ‚úàÔ∏è FAA Flight Safety Data Analysis
Analyzing FAA flight safety and delay data to uncover patterns in operational performance and safety incidents. This research demonstrates how public data can be used to improve transportation systems and inform policy decisions.

### üìä Economic Forecasting with FRED API
Using the Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED) API, I build time series models to forecast key economic indicators such as unemployment rates and inflation. These insights support workforce development strategies and grant proposals at R2W.

### üìà Power BI & DAX Dashboards
Designing and deploying interactive dashboards using Power BI and DAX to visualize KPIs, financial trends, and operational metrics. These tools help stakeholders at R2W and other organizations make data-driven decisions and communicate impact effectively.
